# Offside_Detection_Comptuer_Vision
ntroduction
Offside Rule Illustration

In many sports, referees are tasked with making crucial decisions that can significantly impact the outcome of games. Human bias and inconsistencies, however, mean that errors are inevitable. This project aims to solve this problem in the context of soccer by using computer vision techniques to automatically identify offside positions.

Background
By definition, an attacking player is considered to be in an offside position under certain conditions. The rules are complex but crucial for fair gameplay.

Details of the Approach
YOLOv5 Model
YOLOv5 Architecture

We use the YOLOv5 model for object detection to identify players and their bounding boxes. The model is both fast and accurate, making it ideal for real-time applications.

Bounding Box Explanation
python
Copy code
# Sample code to calculate bounding box coordinates
def calculate_coordinates(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return ((x1 + x2) / 2, y2)
Removing Goalkeeper and Referees
Users need to manually input the IDs of referees and goalkeepers, as they are not considered in offside analysis.

RESNET Model + K-Means Clustering
We employ the ResNet101 neural network to extract high-level features and use k-means clustering to group players based on these features.

Drawbacks
Overfitting risks
Transfer learning limitations
Dominant Color Extraction Technique + K-Means
This method uses k-means clustering to identify the dominant color for each player, aiding in team identification.

Vanishing Point Implementation
Vanishing Point Example

To calculate the vanishing point, we employ techniques like Canny Edge Detection and Hough Line Transform.

Results and Discussion
(TBD)

Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: Accurate, Real-time analysis
Weaknesses: Manual input required for referees and goalkeepers, Potential overfitting
Future Work
Automatic Assignment of Referees & Goalies
Ball Tracking

This is just a sample, and you can customize it according to your project's specific needs. The idea is to make the README visually appealing and informative so that anyone who visits your GitHub repo can quickly understand what your project is about and how it works.
